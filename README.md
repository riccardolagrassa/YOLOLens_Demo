# YOLOLens_Demo

YOLOLens, is a deep learning model specifically optimized for high-resolution crater detection. YOLOLens, an innovative variant of the YOLO architecture, has been fine-tuned to handle the unique challenges of lunar surface imagery, delivering unparalleled accuracy in crater identification and localization. Detailed information on the model architecture and methodology can be found in relevant publications on:

The goal of this repository is to provide the inference and the relative pretrained model supported by his jupiter colab application.
Feel free to use the application as demonstrative tool or for scientific purpose (n.b training, validation are not provided).
